**Gracidea** is a project which aims to gather all known *Pokémon* regions into a single 2D map, keeping maximum fidelity to core games while taking the liberty to fill blanks trough official artworks and make minor arangements so everything fits.

Since *Pokémon* franchise has remakes, third versions and sequels, it sometimes results in redesigns in maps.
Also, as the core games switched to 3D graphics starting on generation 6 and onwards, the maps of newer regions are interpretations of what they could have been if they were in 2D.  

Here are the games which were chosen for representing each region : 
* **Hoenn** : *Pokémon Emerald*

Each *Pokémon* player always had a favorite generation in its heart, and mine belongs to Hoenn. This is why I chose to normalize and serve each region with the tileset of the third generation. 

Maybe this is nostalgia or "It was better then", but I always found that 2D *Pokémon* games had their own charm and this is what gave birth to this project. I hope you'll be able to rediscover this marvellous franchise with this extensive map !
