**Gracidea** is a project which aims to gather all known *Pokémon* regions into a single 2D map, keeping maximum fidelity to core games while taking the liberty to fill blanks trough official artworks and make minor arangements so everything fits.

Since *Pokémon* franchise has remakes, third versions and sequels, it sometimes results in redesigns in maps.
Also, as the core games switched to 3D graphics starting on generation 6 and onwards, the maps of newer regions are interpretations of what they could have been if they were in 2D.  

Here are the games which were chosen for representing each region : 
* **Hoenn** : *Pokémon Emerald*

The *Pokémon* world is huge, and so is the amount of work needed to map it. Wether you want to complete the mapping, provide new sprites or propose new features, you're encouraged to open a pull request ! 

And if you're not very talented apart from knowing your type advantages, you can always reports bugs and other stuff in issues ! 

#### Additional notes
- You can fork this repo, but if you're making a feature which could be integrated in the [original repo](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea), you're encouraged to submit a pull request so everyone can enjoy it !
- Note however that this is only a mapping project, not a game project. Thus, suggestions like adding battles, characters dialogs, gym badges, story progression, and other stuff like this will be rejected from this repo. 
- Despite *Gracidea* being based on *Pokémon* franchise, its code must be able to be dissociated from it (this is why the code never mentions *Pokémon* directly). This means that in case of legal issues with the usage of the franchise, licensed sprites will be removed from repo but the rest will be kept intact.
- The maintainers of this repo cannot be held responsible of the usage of it from other users.

## ![](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea/blob/master/client/imgs/icons/map.png) Note from the cartographer

Each *Pokémon* player always had a favorite generation in its heart, and mine belongs to Hoenn. This is why I chose to normalize and serve each region with the tileset of the third generation. 

Maybe this is nostalgia or "It was better then", but I always found that 2D *Pokémon* games had their own charm and this is what gave birth to this project. I hope you'll be able to rediscover this marvellous franchise with this extensive map !
